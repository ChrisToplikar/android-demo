# android-demo
This is a simple android studio game application I built for my Android Application Development class.  The application is a two player game where the objective is to pilot your own drone.  Players earn points for more dynamic flight manuervers and collecting stars before time runs out.  The player that gets the most points before time runs out wins.  

## Description
The application uses an internal GameLoop to control the main functionality of the game.  MainActivity.java controls the main functionality of the application.  The application also renders sound the the user during certain game conditions, such as when the player's drone hits a wall or a floating star.  The game renders several different images to the user.  The drones in the game are dynamic and move accross screen based on players actions.
